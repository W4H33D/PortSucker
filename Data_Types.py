# Data Types

Here we made a program that print four data types of python

```
#!/usr/bin/python3

a = 10  # Data Type = int

b = 10.1 # Data Type = float

c = 'Hello' # Data Type = string

d = "Hello World" # Data Type = This is also a String Data Type

print(" Data Type = int:",a,"\n Data Type = float:",b,"\n Data Type = string:",c,"\n Data Type = String:",d)
```
