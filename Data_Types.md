# Data Types

Here we made a program that print all data types of python

```
#!/usr/bin/python3

integers = 10  # Data Type = int ## Whole numbers,such as: 3 300 200

floating_point = 10.1 # Data Type = float ## Numbers with a decimal point: 2.3 4.6 100.0

string = 'Hello' # Data Type = str ## Ordered sequence of characters: "hello" or 'hello'

string_also = "Hello world"

lists = [10,"hello",200.3] # Data Type = list ## ordered sequence of objects: [10,"hello",100.3]

dictionary = {"hello":"world","number":"1"} # Data Type = dict ## unordered Key:Value pair: {"mykey":"value","name":"Joe"}

tuples = (10,"hello",200.1) # Data Type = tup ## Ordered ummutable sequence of objects: (10,"hello",100.3)

sets = {"a":"b"} # Data Type = set ## Unordered collections of unique objects: {"a","10"}

booleans = True # Data Type = bool ## Logical value indicating True or False

print("This is integer:",integers,"\nThis is Floating Point:",floating_point,"\n This is String:",string,string_also,"\nThis is List:",lists,"\nThis is dictioary:",dictionary,"\nThis is Tuples:",tuples,"\nThis is Sets:",sets,"\nThis is boolien:",booleans)
```
After execution the output would like this
