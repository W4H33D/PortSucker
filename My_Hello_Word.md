Wellcome to my Hello World Program Where i use `Print()` function that is use to print something on screen.
There syntax is like 
`print(variable_name) OR print("Any String")`
and i use `input()` function that is use to take input from user and there syntax is like
`input("Any string you want to be print on screen")`
and save that input in the variable

user_input = input("Enter Any String: ")
